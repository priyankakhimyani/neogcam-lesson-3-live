        <h3>What is open source</h3>
        <p>We have been using open source since we were a kid for eg: VLC, Google Chrome, Firefox etc. </p>
        <p>Open-Source Projects are projects which are readily available, free to use and free to modify. Open-Source Contribution is basically contributing to the improvement and development of open-source software.</p>
        <p>Some popular Open-Source Software are Android, Android, Linux Operating System, Chromium and VSCode IDE</p>
  
        <h3>Why contributing is important</h3>
        <p>Whether you a student or a working professional open source is a great way to get real world software development experience from the comfort of your home. It helps in strengthening the understanding of the project. You will be able to understand how teams work in an organization.</p>
        <p>You get to help people within the community and create an impact. You also get recognized for your work, this recognition can also end up with a lot of opportunities by potential employers.</p>
        <p>If you want to get a good job opportunity without learning DSA, open is a great way to get such opportunities by doing great work in public</p>


        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>Well you donâ€™t need to be an expert, only the basics is enough </p>
        <h4>Learn a programming language </h4>
        <p>You can choose any programming language and get started. There are a lot of projects available to chose from in every language.</p>
        <h4>Version Control Systems(VCS)</h4>
        <p>They are software tools which help us to store all the changes in order to keep a track of them. These changes in the source code are called different versions and we can also revert to an older version if required at point in time.</p>
        <p>Some examples of VCS are Git, Mercurial, CVS etc.</p>
        <p>Git is the most widely used VCS. GitHub is the place where you keep all your projects and multiple people can work together on those projects</p>
        <p>Here are a few resources which I feel might be helpful <a href="https://lab.github.com/">GitHub Lab</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk">FreeCode Camp Course</a> <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git">GitHub Docs</a></p>

        <h3>How to get started </h3>
        <h4>Open source your projects </h4>
        <p>Showcase your projects on GitHub, this can help you in getting contributions from the community. This will help you to collaborate with developers across the world. Not only this but it will also add value to your project </p>

        <h4>Start with beginner friendly issues </h4>
        <p>Go on GitHub and search easy or beginner-friendly issues. Here are some links which I feel will be helpful. <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afirst-timers-only">First Timers Only issues</a>  <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy">Easy Issues</a> </p>
        <p>You can also find projects or organizations that you are interested in by going to their GitHub repository and searching for easy issues.</p>
            <p>You will fill find links to their Discord or slack on Github. Introduce yourself and ask for help whenever you are stuck.</p>You will fill find links to their Discord or slack on Github. Introduce yourself and ask for help whenever you are stuck.
